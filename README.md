# Mycelium Utensils and Plates

## The Plastic Problem
- There are lots of plastics in the world and it is degrading the environment.
- There needs to be a shift in the industry to create more biodegradeable materials.

## Easy to Make
- The process of making mycelium utensils need to be easy for regular industries to easily create mycelium utensils.
- Low entry barrier for industries to create mycelium utensils.

## Mycelium utensils
- Waterproof utilizing readily found waterproofing materials.
- High durability utilizing techniques of creating dense biomaterials.

## Chaga
- The special properties of chaga make it great for making mycelium based materials.
- Use chitin from any generic mushroom
